# DFS Routing Algorithm Simulation (Java + GraphStream)

This project simulates the Depth-First Search (DFS) Spanning Tree algorithm to demonstrate routing in computer networks. It allows users to create a graph, visualize the DFS traversal, and understand how routing trees are formed using DFS logic.

## 📌 Features

- Create custom graph nodes and edges
- Simulate DFS-based routing algorithm
- Visualize network topology and traversal steps
- View visited nodes and routing tree in GUI

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Java
- [GraphStream](http://graphstream-project.org/) Library
- IntelliJ IDEA (Recommended)
- Java Swing (for GUI)
